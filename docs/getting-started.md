This section will guide you through all necessary and optional installation and configuration steps. By the end of the 
section, you should be able to receive incoming requests from Lokalise.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Requirements

This package requires:
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) 7.4 or 8
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com) 7 or 8

Some features may have additional requirements. These will be listed in the according section of the documentation.

## üßô Installation

You can install this package using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) by running the following command:
```bash
composer require craftzing/laravel-lokalise-webhooks
```

We're using [Laravel's package discovery](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/packages#package-discovery) to automatically
register the service provider, so you don't have to register it yourself.

You can publish the package config file by running the command below, but it's not mandatory:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Craftzing\Laravel\LokaliseWebhooks\LokaliseWebhooksServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

This package is built on top of Spatie's [Laravel webhook client](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-webhook-client).
If you're already using that package for any other webhook integrations, you can skip this next step. If you're not, 
you must run the following commands to publish and run its migrations:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\WebhookClient\WebhookClientServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

To verify that incoming requests originate from your Lokalise project, we need to know the `X-Secret` header Lokalise
will include with every webhook call. Secrets are project-specific and can be found under the webhook integration
settings of your project on Lokalise (https://app.lokalise.com/settings/{yourProjectId}/#integrations/rest-webhook).

Add the `X-Secret` header to your `.env`:
```dotenv
LOKALIZE_X_SECRET=<your-secret> 
```

Next, you must specify the route that will handle incoming Lokalise webhook calls. Head over to your app's routes file
and add the lines below. Under the hood, this will register a `POST` route with a request handler provided by this
package.
```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::lokaliseWebhooks('your-route'); 
```

As Lokalise has no way to set a CSRF token, you must exclude this newly registered route from your app's CSRF
verification. Head over to the `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware and add the route to the `except` array:
```php
protected $except = [
    'your-route',
]; 
```

Now that the route's in place, we can configure it in the Webhook integration settings of your project on Lokalise. Head
over to the webhook integration settings (https://app.lokalise.com/settings/{yourProjectId}/#integrations/rest-webhook)
and fill out the `Webhook URL` field with the route you just added in your app.

Once you hit the `Enable integration` button, a ping request will be made to the provided webhook URL to ensure that it
works properly. Lokalise does not allow you to configure a webhook URL that does not return a successful response.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you're configuring the webhook URL with a route pointing to your localhost, Lokalise will not accept the route
> as your localhost is not accessible to the outside world. To learn more about working with webhooks on your local
> environment, have a look at our [documentation](usage.md#-working-with-webhooks-on-your-local-environment).
